# Challenge 1: Score Board

**Date:** November 12, 2024  
**Difficulty:** ⭐ (1-star)  
**Status:** In Progress

## Objective
Find the hidden Score Board page

## Initial Reconnaissance
- Opened Juice Shop at localhost:3000
- Noticed no obvious "Challenges" or "Score Board" link
- Need to find hidden routes

## Attempts
1. [press F12-Go to Debugger tab-look at the javascript files-search for terms like score or board]

## Solution
[try navigating to: http://localhost:3000/#/score-board]

## What I Learned
[Understanding how web apps hide or protect sensitive pages.]
[Trying common "hidden" URLs (/admin, /score-board, /hidden, etc.]
[Using browser tools (View Source, DevTools) to scan for commented-out hints, hidden routes, or client-side script containing endpoint info.]
[Using DevTools’ Network tab to watch requests and responses—sometimes hidden endpoints are revealed in API calls.]
[Adopting techniques like brute-forcing URLs, using wordlists, or simply creative thinking (“Where would devs hide a Score Board?”)]
[Realizing that non-linked pages are often accessible to anyone who can guess or enumerate, especially in vulnerable web apps.]
